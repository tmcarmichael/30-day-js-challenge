    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // deep copy: stringify and parse the obj results in deep copy instead of shallow copy
    // const obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
